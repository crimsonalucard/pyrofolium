Quick and dirty build and deploy instructions:

make sure you have nodejs, npm and grunt installed.

then with the project folder as your working directory run:

```shell
npm install -d
grunt build
```
The resulting build will be located in a folder called deploy. 
If you would like to deploy on an ftp server you will need to edit the Gruntfile.js at around line 60: 

```js
		'ftp-deploy': {
			deployment:{
				auth:	{
							host:'pyrofolium.com',
							port: 21,
							authKey: 'key1'
						},
				src:'deploy/',
				dest: 'pyrofolium.com/'
			}
		}
```

edit your host and port to be what you need and for your user name and password create a file in the top level directory called .ftppass then format it it like this:

```js
  {
    "key1":{
        "username":"yourusername",
        "password":"yourpassword"
    }
}
```

then run run the command below in your favorite shell:

```shell
  grunt deploy
```

the mobile version of the site is simple template generated by yeoman so it follows the prebuilt deployment procedures. you will need to go into the mobile/ directory and type the following commands respectively to build or to deploy:

```shell
	grunt build
	grunt deploy
```



The mobile version of the site uses seperate deployment procedures.
