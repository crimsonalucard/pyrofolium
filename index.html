			<p class="smallerfont nopaddingnomargin darkfont" id="about">My name is Brian Yeh. I'm a Software Developer based in California. I graduated from UCLA with a degree in Electrical/Computer Engineering and I've been working as a Software Developer ever since. I have a strong interest in technology and programming languages. In my spare time I like to work on various projects and experiment with more obscure languages like scheme or erlang. This site is the result of one of my side-endeavors, built for the purpose of showcasing my work and projects I do in my spare time. I believe in elegance in design and clarity in code. When I'm not busy programming you'll find me in the great outdoors hiking and exploring.</p>

							<h3>Pyrofolium</h3>
							<p>Pyrofolium is the website you are looking at right now. It's sort of an interactive resume and personal site. The objective of the site is to highlight my design and coding ability as well as showcase some side projects. I wanted to make the design more unconventional then the usual portfolio site. With the whole "flat" design philosophy that's pervading the web today, anybody can design a clean and simple layout with minimal skill. I wanted to differentiate myselffrom what's already out there. The key for me was to create something that's simple aesthetically yet demonstrates a unique internal complexity. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="static/images/makingOfCubeFooter.jpg"/>
							<p>Following the theme of being unconventional I used 3D computer modeling to create the logo and it became the backbone of the basic design. In place of the typical design trend of having a full blown photograph as a cover  image I decided to have a sort of artificial 3D model as the cover instead. 3D computer modeling was something I was interested in high school but I never had the opportunity to practically use that skill until now.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="static/images/PyrofoliumSkills.png"/>
							<p>The "skills" page seemed a bit empty so I wanted to add something that would fill the empty space and at the same time highlight my abilities. The colorful ring around the list of "skills" is the result of this. It is actually composed of hundreds of tiny scalable vector graphic arc paths. When you hover your mouse over one of these elements it will trigger a sort of "wave" around the circle. This is achieved through recursively calling a function on successive elements that essentially temporarily "bulges" the thickness of each arc element.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="static/images/PyrofoliumMask.png" />
							<p>The "cutout" effect was probably the single hardest effect. Essentially it is just a mask placed over a fixed HTML element. The challenge in creating this effect lies in browser fragmentation.  Webkit, firefox and IE all need different implementations to achieve the effect.  Webkit can mask html elements with any geometric shape with a single line of css, firefox needs you to embed the html in an svg foreignObject. IE doesn't support either of these effects so the IE version of the site utilizes a completely different design that doesn't use the "cutout" effect. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="static/images/pyrocubes.jpg"/>
							<p>For some crazy reason I thought it would be a good learning experience if I restricted myself to only using jquery as a library. It was a good experience but it's also a huge headache reimplementing the wheel. At the same time, however, the unique interface would not have been possible if I used prefabricated components like jquery plugins, twitter bootstrap and the like. If you're interested the source code, it is available <a href="https://github.com/crimsonalucard/pyrofolium">here</a>.</p>

							<p>Brewwy was an idea a client had about creating a website for bars and other nightlife venues. It was essentially sort of yelp/groupon hybrid that targeted young adults. The client never ended up going live with the site but the work I did represented my first foray into web development. I used django with postgresql to build an entire CMS system that the client could update seamlessly with timed deals, photographs, descriptions and conduct operations without ever touching or seeing a line of code. Users could sign up with facebook read and search for reviews about specific venues and present emailed deal coupons to specific venues.</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Django is probably the most bloated (albeit highly modular) web framework for python. The framework will literally force you to follow a strict pattern. If you follow the pattern, entire feature-sets including a full CMS can be automatically layered over your database design. Using Django I delivered a full production ready website with detailed user management/search capabilities, however it was unfortunate that the client wasn't able to take his idea any further. The source for the site is available (with permission from the client) here, and you can view a sample deployment of the site here.</p>
